# Graphics3D-v2
"A second attempt at 3D graphics"

- Small-ish library/visual studio project which holds the basic necessities for rendering objects defined in .obj files.
- Only drawing calls are made using the SetPixel(x,y,color) method for a modified bitmap class.
- All other 3D vector arithmetic/projection done in this software in the camera's Render method and helper methods.
